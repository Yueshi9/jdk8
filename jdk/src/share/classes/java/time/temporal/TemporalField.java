 * A field of date-time, such as month-of-year or hour-of-minute.

 * Further fields are supplied in {@link IsoFields}, {@link WeekFields} and {@link JulianFields}.

 * If it is, then the date-time must handle it.
 * Otherwise, the method call is re-dispatched to the matching method in this interface.

 * @implSpec
 * This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
 * All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 * Implementations should be {@code Serializable} where possible.
